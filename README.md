# ROS Robot Detection Module

## Introduction
The ROS Robot Detection Module, located at `ros_rosbot_ws/src/detection/src`, is designed for real-time image processing and object detection in robotics and computer vision applications. This module integrates functionalities for video streaming, point cloud generation, and object detection using advanced models like YOLOv8, optimized with TensorRT.

## Get Started
To install and use this codebase, follow these steps:

**Installation**:
   - Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including ROS, OpenCV, and TensorRT.
   - Clone the repository and navigate to the `ros_rosbot_ws` directory.
   - Build the workspace using the following command:
     ```bash
     catkin_make
     ```
## Feature
This module supports the following key functionalities:

- **Real-time Video Streaming**: Capture and process video streams for immediate analysis.
- **Point Cloud Generation**: Create 3D point clouds from video data for spatial understanding.
- **Object Detection**: Utilize YOLOv8 for detecting various objects in images.
- **Pose Estimation**: Analyze the position and orientation of detected objects.
- **Segmentation**: Classify and segment different parts of an image.

These features are particularly useful in robotics applications where real-time decision-making is crucial, such as autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance.

## Implementation
The module consists of several key files:

1. **camera.cpp**: 
   - **Location**: `ros_rosbot_ws/src/detection/src/camera.cpp`
   - **Functionality**: Implements an image processing module for real-time video streaming and point cloud generation.

2. **control.cpp**: 
   - **Location**: `ros_rosbot_ws/src/detection/src/control.cpp`
   - **Functionality**: Implements a ROS node for handling UDP communication and processing results from a detection system.

3. **model.cpp**: 
   - **Location**: `ros_rosbot_ws/src/detection/src/model.cpp`
   - **Functionality**: Implements a ROS node for detecting objects using a YOLOv8 model, processing images from shared memory.

### Submodule: YOLOv8
The YOLOv8 submodule provides a comprehensive object detection system utilizing TensorRT, including functionalities for model weight conversion, classification, detection, pose estimation, and segmentation. Borrowed from [TensorRTx](https://github.com/wang-xinyu/tensorrtx)

## Acknowledgement
This module relies on several external third-party libraries:

- **OpenCV**: A powerful library for image processing and computer vision tasks, used for deep learning image processing.
- **TensorRT**: A high-performance deep learning inference library that optimizes models for deployment, particularly for NVIDIA GPUs.
Thank you for using the ROS Robot Detection Module!
